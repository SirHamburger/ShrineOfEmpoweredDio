# ShrineOfEmpoweredDio

This is a mod for Risk of Rain 2 where Dios are reusable.
The mod is based on Shrine of Dios mod from https://github.com/MagnusMagnuson/RoR2Mods.
So most of the credits belongs to him.

On stage 5 a shrine of Dios will spawn which looks like the shrine of woods. This one will be quite expensive but can refill your used Dios.

If you've any issues with that mod please contact me on Discord (Sir Hamburger#8447) or add an issue to the github repository (https://github.com/SirHamburger/ShrineOfEmpoweredDio)
